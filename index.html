            <p>
                This is from my Osoyoos trip my family and I went on a few months ago near the end of August.
                Here you can see one small part of one thousand acre grapevine patch among the hundreds of wineries they have sprawled out across the valley.
                It may not be obvious from the photo, but if you were to look to your right or left in this photo, the sea of green foliage would span as far as the eye can see.
                We did a tasting tour which was around an hour just visiting different wineries, and the furthest one was about a half an hour ride from our hotel and even once we got there, the vineyards still spanned out endlessly ahead.
                However, I found the most uncanny part to be the almost barren hills which we naturally assume would be covered in a dense blanket of forests, which I compared to unrendered mountains in a video game like GTA 5.

            <h2>New York</h2>
            <p>
                This was another memorable, big trip to the Big Apple, as a belated birthday present from my family which I greatly appreciate and enjoyed.
                I believe this was the view from our hotel room believe it or not, overlooking Central Park and directly behind us, only a few blocks away, was the Rockefeller Building which we visited too.
                I could go on forever about all the attractions and locations we visited while we were there, or just how absolutely massive Central Park is, but really the most enjoyable part was being there with my family and getting to experience all these things with them.
                Though my second favorite experience was definitely the Broadway Shows of which I was lucky enough to see two, Lion King and Stranger Things which was basically brand new there and would highly recommend seeing if you're a fan of the series and are in NYC, just make sure to buy the tickets 10-6 months in advance.

            <h2>Ancient Greece</h2>
            <p>
                 This is one of my oldest photos back from when I went to Greece back in 2019 which I was a dream of mine for years as I had a pretty big obsession with Greek Mythology at the time.
                For this trip I basically served as a tour guide, planning out which islands we should visit and all the places of importance I wanted to experience in person and while there, describing the myths in great detail to my family whether they wanted to hear it or not.
                Here you can see another hotel photo of when we stayed in Athens, albeit quite grainy as we stayed at an AirBnB that was a ways away from the city.
                The most memorable experience I would say was on the island of Crete within the cave foretold to be the birthplace of the Lightning God Zeus, but a close second would be the island of Santorini, whose sunsets are almost a requirement to see for any tourist.
                Overall I'd say this trip may be one of my favorites of all time, with the New York trip at a close second place, just because of the personal significance it had with 12-year-old me at that time.

    <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
    <h4>There is no personal tier-list of vacations I've been on, and there are plenty I'm leaving out that I like just as much as the ones on this list, so I'd say that these are just some of my favorite trips.</h4>
